```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A work-in-progress, soon to have a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ludwa6/GROW) for open collaboration, there is a [placeholder page at Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/ludwa6/GROW) that we'll try to keep in sync with this one on GitHub as we go.

## Specific Context

This project has grown out of two different tracks of development, essentially:

- **Regenerative Farming** at [Quinta Vale da Lama](https://www.valedalama.net)
- **GROW Observatory:** _The Sensing Mission_

## Larger Purpose

- Citizen Science
- Reproducible Research
- Intelligence Augmentation

## Technology

This project depends on a number of technologies, including...

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
