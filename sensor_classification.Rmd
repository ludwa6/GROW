A first pass at publishing a sensor classification table, and analysis thereon... But first, i must find out to create and publish this .Rmd document with embedded code.  Let's give it a shot:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```
## SECTION 0: Load Tools ----
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

## SECTION 1: Load Data ----

### the CSV file from AirTable (sensor classification and state)
MyData <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/sensing_mission/Grow/data/airtable_combi.csv")
MyData <- tbl_df(MyData)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
